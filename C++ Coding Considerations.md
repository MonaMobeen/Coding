C++ Coding Considerations
This concise guide outlines key points to consider while coding in C++.

1. Fundamentals:

Grasp the basics: Master variables, data types (int, float, char, etc.), operators (+, -, *, /), control flow (if, else, for, while), and functions.
Understand object-oriented programming (OOP): Learn about classes, objects, inheritance, polymorphism, and encapsulation.
2. Data Structures & Algorithms:

Choose appropriate data structures: Arrays, pointers, structures, unions, linked lists, stacks, queues, trees, and graphs each have their strengths and weaknesses. Learn their uses and trade-offs.
Design efficient algorithms: Strive for algorithms that solve problems in an optimal way (e.g., sorting algorithms like bubble sort vs. quick sort).
3. Memory Management:

Be mindful of memory: Understand the difference between stack and heap memory. Use new and delete responsibly to avoid memory leaks. Consider smart pointers for automatic memory management.
4. Input/Output (I/O):

Utilize standard streams: Use cin for input and cout for output. Explore ifstream and ofstream for file handling.
5. Error Handling:

Anticipate errors: Use try-catch blocks to handle exceptions gracefully. Validate user inputs to prevent unexpected program behavior.
6. Readability & Maintainability:

Write clear code: Use meaningful variable names, proper indentation, and comments to explain your code.
Consider modularity: Break down complex problems into smaller, reusable functions.
7. Debugging:

Develop debugging skills: Use a debugger to step through your code, identify errors, and fix them effectively. Learn to read error messages and stack traces.
