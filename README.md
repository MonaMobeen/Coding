**MAANG Interview Preparation**

You should start with:

- Clean code
- Data structures
- Algorithms

**For data structures**, look at reviewing:

- Array
- LinkedList
- Stack
- Queue
- HashMap
- Tree
- Graph

**For algorithms**, look at reviewing:

- Sort algorithms — merge sort, quick sort, bucket sort, heap sort
- Search algorithms — binary, depth-first, breadth-first
- Greedy algorithms — Kruskal’s, Dijkstra’s

**Coding Considerations**   

1. Fundamentals:
Grasp the basics: Master variables, data types (int, float, char, etc.), operators (+, -, *, /), control flow (if, else, for, while), and functions. Understand object-oriented programming (OOP): Learn about classes, objects, inheritance, polymorphism, and encapsulation.

2. Data Structures & Algorithms:

Choose appropriate data structures: Arrays, pointers, structures, unions, linked lists, stacks, queues, trees, and graphs each have their strengths and weaknesses. Learn their uses and trade-offs. Design efficient algorithms: Strive for algorithms that solve problems in an optimal way (e.g., sorting algorithms like bubble sort vs. quick sort).
